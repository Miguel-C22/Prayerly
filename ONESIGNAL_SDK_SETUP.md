# OneSignal SDK Integration - Complete ‚úÖ

## What Changed

Successfully migrated to OneSignal SDK approach (no VAPID key needed!)

### Files Updated

1. **`/app/layout.tsx`**
   - Added OneSignal SDK script from CDN
   - Initialized OneSignal with your App ID
   - Automatically loads on all pages

2. **`/components/notifications/PushNotificationSettings.tsx`**
   - Completely rewritten to use OneSignal SDK
   - Uses `OneSignal.Slidedown.promptPush()` for permission
   - Gets subscription ID directly from SDK
   - No more manual VAPID key handling

3. **`/app/api/user/push-subscribe/route.ts`**
   - Simplified - OneSignal SDK creates the player automatically
   - Just saves subscriber ID to database
   - Tags OneSignal player with Supabase user ID

4. **`/app/api/cron/send-reminders/route.ts`**
   - No changes needed - already uses OneSignal REST API

5. **`/public/OneSignalSDKWorker.js`**
   - New service worker file for OneSignal SDK
   - Imports OneSignal service worker code from CDN

6. **`.env.local`**
   - Removed VAPID key (not needed with SDK)
   - Kept App ID and REST API Key

### Files Removed

- ‚ùå `/public/webpushr-sw.js` (old Webpushr service worker)
- ‚ùå `/public/sw.js` (native Push API service worker)
- ‚ùå `ONESIGNAL_SETUP.md` (outdated setup guide)

## Environment Variables (Already Set ‚úÖ)

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=761b630f-2886-4baa-a3ee-500605b46f3a
ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY=os_v2_app_oynwgdziqzf2vi7okadalndphiavvjobsrau5ffzef5zrxrty73riy45pk6fkdlgry3ahxd2ndvb6c5vxw5qo4tmvsqjxzehnt2qlnq
```

## How It Works Now

### Subscription Flow (Frontend)

1. User clicks "Enable Push Notifications"
2. `OneSignal.Slidedown.promptPush()` shows permission dialog
3. OneSignal SDK automatically:
   - Requests browser permission
   - Creates subscription
   - Registers with OneSignal backend
   - Returns player ID (subscriber ID)
4. We save player ID to Supabase
5. We tag the player with our user ID

### Notification Flow (Backend)

1. Cron job runs (`/api/cron/send-reminders`)
2. Fetches due reminders from Supabase
3. Groups by user + channel
4. For push notifications:
   - Gets all user's subscriber IDs from database
   - Calls OneSignal API with `include_player_ids`
   - OneSignal delivers to all devices
5. Browser receives push event
6. OneSignal service worker displays notification

## Testing

### 1. Local Testing

```bash
npm run dev
```

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/reminders
2. Click "Enable Push Notifications"
3. Should see OneSignal permission prompt (slidedown)
4. Grant permission
5. Check browser console - should see subscription ID logged
6. Verify in Supabase `push_subscriptions` table

### 2. Verify in OneSignal Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.onesignal.com/apps/761b630f-2886-4baa-a3ee-500605b46f3a
2. Click **Audience** ‚Üí **All Users**
3. You should see your device listed
4. Click on it to see details and tags (should have `user_id` tag)

### 3. Send Test Notification

**Option A: Via OneSignal Dashboard**
1. Go to **Messages** ‚Üí **New Push**
2. Select "Send to Test Device"
3. Enter your player ID
4. Send

**Option B: Wait for Scheduled Reminder**
- Set a prayer reminder for a few minutes from now
- Enable push channel
- Wait for cron job to trigger

### 4. Production Deployment

Update environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/your-project/settings/environment-variables
2. Make sure these are set:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID`
   - `ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY`
3. Redeploy

## Troubleshooting

### "OneSignal not loaded" Error
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for script loading errors
- Verify App ID in `.env.local`

### Permission Prompt Not Showing
- Clear browser data and try again
- Check if notifications are blocked in browser settings
- Try a different browser

### Subscription Saved But No Notifications
- Verify subscriber ID exists in Supabase
- Check OneSignal dashboard for delivery status
- Check browser console for service worker errors

### Multi-Device Testing
- Subscribe on multiple devices (phone, laptop, different browsers)
- Each should create a separate row in `push_subscriptions`
- All devices should receive notifications

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Code is ready - no VAPID key needed!
2. üß™ Test locally
3. üì± Test on phone (use ngrok or deploy to Vercel)
4. üöÄ Deploy to production
5. üìä Monitor OneSignal dashboard for delivery stats

## Benefits of SDK Approach

‚úÖ **No VAPID key management** - OneSignal handles it
‚úÖ **Easier setup** - Just add App ID
‚úÖ **Better UX** - Native OneSignal permission prompt
‚úÖ **Auto service worker** - No manual service worker code
‚úÖ **Built-in features** - Analytics, A/B testing, etc.
‚úÖ **Multi-device support** - Works seamlessly

Everything is configured and ready to test! üéâ
